# Conecopia Gelato LLC Ecommerce Website
(Currently still in development)

This is the Conecopia Gelato e-commerce platform. This platform is meant to replace the legacy gelato pre-ordering platform built back when I was in highschool. 

## Technical Stack

### Front End**

#### Standard HTML/CSS (No Frameworks)
I chose to use no frontend framework for this project because I felt that Django's built in templating syntax in combination with JQuery and vanilla JavaScript would be sufficent to all of the dynamic needs of this application. I also didn't want to use Django as a REST server as I wanted to experience the MVC architechture style that Django is known for.

#### Preline w/ Tailwind CSS
I used Preline in combination with Tailwind CSS to make dealing with styling easier. Rather than maintaining a varity of stylesheets in Django's static directory, I only have to deal with one master stylesheet. Preline helps as it contains a lot of prebuilt components that are already ADA compliant and well thought out. I used preline's components as a boilerplate to build off of.

### Back End

#### Python Django
I chose Django becuse I knew this project was going to be specialized. I felt that if at any point I needed to move beyong the scope of what the monolithic architechure could provide, then I'd have to rewrite most of my code anyway.

#### SQLite
The current version of my software uses SQLite 3 as its database. I chose SQLite because its portable, clean, and doesn't require any special infrastructure to develop on.
